File for chat application


A simple chat application implemented in Java using sockets. It consists of two main components: the server (ChatServer) and the client (ChatClient). The server allows multiple clients to connect simultaneously and communicate with each other in a chat room-like environment.

Features
- *Multiple Client Support*: The server supports multiple clients connected at the same time.
- *Unique Client IDs*: Each client is assigned a unique ID when connecting.
- *Broadcast*: Messages sent by any client are broadcast to all other connected clients.
- *Error Handling*: Basic error handling is implemented to handle I/O exceptions and prevent duplicate messages.

the use
Server (chat server)
1. Compile the file "ChatServer.java": "javac ChatServer.java".
2. Run the compiled ChatServer class: java ChatServer.
3. The server will start and listen for incoming client connections on port 12345.

 Client (chat client)
1. Compile the "ChatClient.java" file: "javac ChatClient.java".
2. Run the compiled "ChatClient" class: "java ChatClient".
3. The client will connect to the server running on “localhost” and port “12345”.
4. Enter your messages at the console prompt and press Enter to send them to the server.

Communications protocol
- The server assigns a unique ID to each client when they connect.
- Messages sent by clients are prefixed with their IDs before broadcast.
- The client receives messages from the server and displays them in the console.

requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

Notes
- Server and client classes must run on separate stations or instances.
- To connect clients across different devices, modify the server address in the ChatClient constructor to the IP address or hostname of the device running the server.
